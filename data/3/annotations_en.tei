          It is easy to play thorough bass well, when no more figures appear than in this example. Alas! How happy some will
          be, that there are so few figures here. To admit the truth, now and then I have to allow people to fetch breath again – otherwise
          it would turn too sour for them. It could be, however, that in consideration of the supposed advantage,  since we do not
          accept any apprentices in this class anymore, but only seniors, one or the other signature is not written so precisely,
          but left out on porpose: so that a player sharpens his own judgement and learns to walk without a stick.

          Besides, I can say, that in the present piece one has to consider the useful training of a good application of the moving fingers.
          In this particular case one cannot be suprised enough about the nasty stumbling of the apprentices, especially when
          the bass moves downwards a lot. This only stems from the the fact, that their fingers do neither keep a certain order nor
          have indicated ways. Every master (the one who understands) does make his own thing out of it and gives three or four rules
          by which the pupil should learn which fingers to use up- and downwards in both hands. This all is certainly good and 
          may have as much use as the rules of a skilled calligraph. However, that notwithstanding, with the own understanding increasing, one does
          not care at all. But there are only few, who do not choose their own hand for writing, which often is not the same as the one
          of the master. It is the same with the application on the clavier. As many there are playing, as many ways of the so-called
          <emph>application</emph> one will find. One plays with four fingers, the other one with five and several play almost as
          fast with only two fingers. There is nothing about it, as long as one chooses a certain guideline and sticks to it. But that is it:
          Most are so full of doubts and unfirm about this thing, that they need a quarter of an hour before they come to terms with themselves.
          Therefore I do not recommend any specific application, but I demand, that one accustoms himself to only one way firmly and steady through
          industrious exercise. But so that it will fit in every case: Which requires thinking.
          It only remains to observe that in the very common scales, one plays upwards in the hand with the ring and middle finger
          and uses middle and index for going down. The left hand however makes use of the index and the thumb upwards and downwards of the index
          and middle finger in an alternating way. I am saying, that this is the common way and teaching, but it is suitable in only very few cases.

          In the <ref target="m-407">tenth</ref> and <ref target="m-438">11th measure</ref>
          the right hand plays on the break, which gives a pleasant arpeggiation. In <ref target="m-603">b. 17</ref> it will be turned 
          upside down. Here, the bass is played at first and then the right hand syncopates with the figures and chords in the previous way.
          That way all crotchets followed by semiquavers are being treated:

          It is to be noted, that all arpeggiations of that kind sound way more pleasant, the more distant the intervals are from 
          each other: they must never get smaller than a fourth. The thirds, especially in the right hand, sound too narrow and can
          be used almost never; so when in the
          <ref target="m-932">26th measure</ref> a <emph>B major</emph> is placed one must not leap upwards from the third or octave,
          but only from the fifth into the third (i.e. in sixths).
