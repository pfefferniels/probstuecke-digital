          It is easy to play thorough bass, when no more figures come up than in this example. Alas! How happy some will
          be, that there are so few figures here. To admit the truth, now and then I have to allow people to take breath – otherwise
          it would turn too sour for them. It could be, however, that in consideration of the supposed advantage,  since we do not
          anymore accept any apprentices in this class, but only seniors, one or the other signature is not written so precisely,
          but left out on porpose: so that a player sharpens his own judgement and learns to walk without a stick.

          Besides, I can say, that in the present rule one has to consider the useful training of a good order of the moving fingers.
          In this particular case one cannot be suprised enough about the nasty stumbling of the appentices, especially when
          the bass often moves downwards. This only stems from the the fact, that their fingers do neither keep a certain order nor
          have pointed-out ways. Every master (the one who understands) does make his own thing out of it and gives three or four rules,
          through which the pupil should learn which fingers to use up- and downwards in both hands. This all is certainly good and 
          may have as much use as the rules of a skilled calligraph. However, that notwithstanding, with the own reason increasing one does
          not care at all. But there are only few, who do not choose their own hand for writing, which often is not the same as the one
          of the master. It's the same with the finger-order on the clavier. As many as there are playing, as many ways of the so-called
          <emph>Application</emph> one will find. The one plays with four fingers, the other with five and quite some play almost the same
          fast with only two fingers. There is nothing about it, as long as one chooses a certain guideline and sticks to it. But that is it:
          The most are so full of doubts and unfirm about this thing, that they need a quarter of an hour before they come to terms with themselves.
          Therefore I do not propose any particular order, but I demand, that one accustoms himself to only one way firmly and unmovable through
          diligent exercise. There is only to observe that in the very common scales, one plays upwards in the hand with the ring and middle finger
          and uses middle and index for going down. The left hand however makes use of the index and the thumb upwards and downwards of the index
          and middle finger in an alternating way. I am saying, that this is the common way and teaching, but it is suitable in only very few cases.

          Im <ref target="m-407">zehnten</ref> und <ref target="m-438">folgenden Tact</ref> schlägt die rechte Hand allemahl vor, wo die Pause
          stehet, solches giebt eine gar angenehme Brechung. Im <ref target="m-603">siebenzehnten Tact</ref> aber wird es umgekehrt,
          und da schlägt der Baß seine ehrbaren Viertel voran, wozu die rechte Hand, mit den Signaturen oder Accorden, auf die 
          vorige Weise syncopirt. Eben. also wird es mit allen vorkommenden Vierteln gehalten, die durch Sechzehn-Theile abgehöst
          werden, etwa auf diese Art:

        <p>
          Wobey ebenfalls zu mercken: daß alle dergleichen BRechungen um so viel angenehmer klingen, je weiter die Intervalle
          voneinander entlegen sind: solche müssen wol nie kleiner werden, als eine Quarte. denn die Verhältniß der Tertzen
          (zumahl in der rechten Hand) klingt gar zu enge, und kann fast nicht gebraucht werden. Wenn demnach im
          <ref target="m-932">sechs- und zwantzigsten Tact</ref> <emph>H dur</emph> stehet, muß nicht von der Tertz,
          vielwenige von der Octave, sonder bloß von der Quint in die 
          Tertz, Sexten-Weise, aufwärts gesprungen werden.
