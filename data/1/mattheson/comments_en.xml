          The clergyman wished to compare the cheerless days of man's life with something and said
          they were like a musical book, in which commonly more black than white notes are to be found; his opinion was that
          similarly we encounter more misfortune than fortune in our lives. Whether or not the simile is lopsided, we will leave to rest.
          to me it appeared very ridiculous. For black notes imply a quick way of playing, signifying something cheerful rather than
          something sad. However, if the black color merely indicates an image of misery, one should rather choose a church or another assembly
          of the clergy, than a music book; since there are found more black than white clothes. I say it so that nobody thinks,
          he will be led into the school of fear and of the cross because of the slightly black notes in that class. Not at all, nobody
          may be afraid: for our notes are genuinely characteristics of a cheerful temper, of a brisk mind and of a happy heart. Have courage,
          that is the best advice.

          The quavers or plain notes in the <ref target="#m-503">sixteenth</ref>, <ref target="#m-550">seventeenth</ref> and
          <ref target="#m-605">eighteenth</ref> measure indicate by themselves, that something varying might be added in the right
          hand. It has to be taken from the previous music how exactly it should be done: since this work is disposed in a way, that
          everything in a piece has been there already or it will show up soon, when something extrodinary has to be done. Thus, everything
          coheres so naturally and differs so little from the main theme, that it is rather easy to find the right opinion. In order
          not to be accused once more of speaking in riddles, those few bars shall give an instruction for further reflection:

          It hopefully has been said often enough that the left hand has to play the figures and chords when playing this decoration.
          Often I would have liked to just put the bass as it should be, if only the notes could be printed into each other<note type="footnote">?</note>

          A nother instance occurs in the <ref target="#m-781">23rd measure</ref>, so that the previous can be taken for advice.
          In the <ref target="#m-802">24th measure</ref> thirds can be played, together with a full-voice texture.
          In the <ref target="#m-863">25th measure</ref> it is done as before.
          The <ref target="#m-997">29th</ref>, <ref target="#m-1027">30th</ref> and <ref target="#m-1069">31st measure</ref> allow for a
          changing, since the right hand imitates the left hand and modulates in quarter notes according to the motive. Whomever it seems obscure, should
          look at this line:<note type="editorial">Here Mattheson mistakenly shifted the bar line for a quarter note.</note>

          In the <ref target="#m-1123">33rd measure</ref> it might not sound bad, when, together with the chords
          and also with sixths and fifths, somewhat more is played and syncopated, in about the following manner:
