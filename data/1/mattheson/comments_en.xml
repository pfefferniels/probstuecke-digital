          This clergyman wished to compare the cheerless days of man's life with something and said
          they were like a musical book, in which commonly more black than white notes are to be found; his opinion was that
          similarly we encounter more misfortune than fortune in our lives. Whether or not the simile is lopsided, we will leave to rest.
          To me it appeared very ridiculous. For black notes imply a quick way of playing, signifying something cheerful rather than
          something sad. However, if the black color merely indicates an image of misery, one should rather choose a church or another assembly
          of the clergy than a music book since there are always found more black than white clothes. I elaborate on this so that nobody thinks,
          he will be led into the school of fear or of the cross due to the slightly black notes in that class. Not at all, nobody
          should be afraid: for our notes are typical features of a cheerful temper, of a brisk mind and of a happy heart. Cheer up,
          that is the best advice.

          The quavers or plain notes in the <ref target="#m-503">sixteenth</ref>, <ref target="#m-550">seventeenth</ref>, and
          <ref target="#m-605">eighteenth</ref> measure indicate by themselves, that something varying might be applied in the right
          hand. How exactly it has to be done should be derived from the previous material. For this work is disposed in such a way, that
          everything in the piece has either already been there or it will soon appear, what unique thing might be done. Thus, everything
          coheres so naturally and differs so little from the main theme that it is rather easy to get the point. In order
          not to be accused once more of speaking in riddles, the following may give instructions for further reflection:

          It hopefully has been said often enough that the left hand has to play the figures and chords when playing this figuration.
          I would often have liked to put it down in the bass just as it should be, if only the notes could be printed together
          as they can be written or engraved on copper.

          The same instance occurs in the <ref target="#m-781">23rd measure</ref>, so that the previous can be taken for advice.
          In the <ref target="#m-802">24th measure</ref> thirds can be played, together with a full-voice texture.
          In the <ref target="#m-863">25th measure</ref> it is done as before.
          The <ref target="#m-997">29th</ref>, <ref target="#m-1027">30th</ref> and <ref target="#m-1069">31st measure</ref> allow for an
          alternation as the right hand imitates the left and modulates on the quarter notes according to the motive. If it seems incomprehensible,
          look at this line:<note type="editorial">Here, Mattheson mistakenly shifted the bar line for a quarter note.</note>

          In the <ref target="#m-1123">33rd</ref> measure it might not sound bad, if the chords, including sixths and fifths,
          were played and syncopated a little more than usual, approximately as below:
          <note type="editorial">In the following example, Mattheson
          changed the left-hand-motive into a dactylic rhythm.</note>
