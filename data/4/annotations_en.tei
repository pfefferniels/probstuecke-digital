          The first <ref target="m-35">four notes</ref> of this piece are to be played unbroken, with four full and short strokes, and on the
          <ref target="m-50">fifth</ref> one should do a sharp trill in the lowest octave. <ref target="m-53">The following measure</ref>
          is played as written. The <ref target="m-138">first six notes in the fourth measure</ref> have to be doubled with octaves, and
          in the right hand the figure has to be used, that immediately follows

          in the bass:

          In the <ref target="m-158">last half of the mentioned fourth measure</ref> the right hand has to play six times per crotchet. This
          is to be done in all similiar cases. Those crotchets are, as you can see, composed of eight notes or divided into the same amount of parts.
          I remind this, since it might
          appear strange to the reader, that in just one crotchet he should play six times with the right hand. The <ref target="m-176">fifth bar</ref>
          wants octaves again and in the discant the above mentioned, transposed figure, starting from an <hi rendition="#b">e</hi>. With that the
          <ref target="m-229">sixth</ref> and <ref target="m-276">seventh measure</ref> alternate as well, each in its own tonality.

          The <ref target="m-327">eighth bar</ref> develops the described interlude three times in ascending degrees in the right hand, while
          the bass is doubled, in this way:
          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example2.mei" />
          </notatedMusic>
          In the <ref target="m-405">ninth bar</ref> the very first motive comes in again. Here the discant can easily find a subtle melody in quavers
          and the bass can be played full-voiced. In the <ref target="m-415">tenth bar</ref> one must not forget the trill on the first note; In the
          <ref target="m-423">eleventh</ref> there is nothing to remind of.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div n="4" type="section">
        <head>§. 4.</head>
        <p>
          The <ref target="m-468">twelfth bar</ref> wants to be played full-voiced in the bass, while the right hand can make use of everything
          that has been there in the previous measure only by changing the <hi rendition="#b">g</hi> to a <hi rendition="#b">d</hi> and continues like that. The
          <ref target="m-533">thirteenth measure</ref> is to be played as written: and the <ref target="m-588">first half of the fourteenth</ref> demands
          one to begin with a little interlude in the discant in the following way:
          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example3.mei" />
          </notatedMusic>
          The same can be done a tone lower in the first half of the <ref target="m-651">fifteenth measure</ref> and in the
          <ref target="m-763">seventeenth measure</ref> one only has to observe what has been said in the § 1.

          Now it has been indicated in § 3. how to deal with notes as they show up again in <ref target="m-928">m. 21</ref> and <ref target="m-947">m. 22</ref>;
          if, however, somebody
          wants to do a variation here, it will be even more pleasant to listen to. Once more a trill in m. 22 shall be recommended, that is to say in the low
          octave. It cannot do harm if somebody wants to try this trill simultaneously in the right hand in sixths.

        <p>
          Now we turn around the motive in  <ref target="m-962">m. 23</ref> a little and take it in the right hand as it can be seen in the next beats in the
          bass: but a third higher. An enthusiast of counterpoint will take the opportunity to note that both motives can be inverted back- and forward;
          however it is not our intention here to play it that way on the keyboard and it is not feasible in all pieces.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div n="7" type="section">
        <head>§. 7.</head>
        <p>
          In <ref target="m-1078">m. 25</ref> the simple motive of the beginning occurs once more. Since it can be heard for the fourth time it fairly deserves
          an ornamentation in the right hand. The usual counter-motive has to be taken from the fourth bar in my opinion, and should be played there as well as
          here in that way:
          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example4.mei" />
          </notatedMusic>

          From this one can see, that these things are not just whims, empty motives, unordered and wild ideas or dry basses: but everything is connected,
          there is almost no note to be found that is without relation to the others. After having played to counter-motive a couple of times it may well be
          varyied for the third and fourth time in that way.

          Was has been there in m. 23 comes in again in <ref target="m-1117">m. 26</ref>, <ref target="m-1191">m. 27</ref> and
          <ref target="m-1247">m. 28</ref> etc. with the necessary changes.
          The last six notes in <ref target="m-1373">m. 30</ref> also require a special discant. And then one can play the end as firmly
          as one's fingers can suffer.
