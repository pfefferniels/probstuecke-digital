            One gets tired of learning. All music has to have its variety, and when one has thundered
            on the keyboard for long, a calm must follow. In my opinion a sweet and tender melody has to follow on something
            rustling and roaring.

            So that one does not feel a lack of it, the occasion to display
            his inventory is given to the lover of a mannered playing in the present instruction, namely in those places, where the words
            <ref target="#m-120"><hi rendition="#aq"><foreign xml:lang="ita">si suona</foreign></hi></ref> are found,
            meaning <hi rendition="#b">one plays</hi>, that is to say for the best, i.e. one plays something peculiar in the right hand.
            To say anything certain
            or proper about how this intended playing should be disposed is a sheer impossibility: since it must flow from free ideas and shall
            not be laboured. Generally this can be said, that the bass accompanies or plays full-voiced, while the right hand plays
            solo in the most cantabile way. The bass progressions are set so easily and naturally, that one would have to be very inexperienced
            if he does not immediately invent a neat voice to it, since the figured bass includes everything in itself already
            and puts it in the hand, so to speak. With that piece one may test his candidate and not think much
            of his art if he does not pass it.

          <p>
            Where the <ref target="#m-61"><hi rendition="#aq"><foreign xml:lang="ita">Presto</foreign></hi></ref> appears, one plays the keyboard in the strongest way
            and rapidly strikes to every note, since this variety is not unpleasing, but will encourage the student and amuse the listener.

            My remark about this very common key, (which is a trump for the tinkler) would else be,
            that as much as one can compose and play with compliments
            something fluent and lively in a sad and minor key, something tender and agile will not sound bad in this popular and major key,
            e.g. a solo on the
            <foreign xml:lang="fra">Viole d'Amour etc.</foreign>
          </p>

            By the way, here the sentence is proven, that one who cannot sing does not know how to play.
            This might seem implausible to some organists, especially those in the cities, who do not fulfill
            the sexton duties at the same time. For on the countryside
            one is out of poverty and sparingness so modest and will contradict me so little in that, that both duties are given to one person,
            through which many voices accrue in my opinion. But jokes aside. Who does not want to believe me and so many honest
            and upright men, shall try out the church music, that an organist not able to sing has created (for those people have fruitful nights, in which
            dozens of their mushrooms – I mean, their so-called <foreign>compositiones</foreign> force their way out of the earth)
            and shall listen, how badly the melodies are arranged, how poor it sounds. Who wants to go further,
            shall let such a person inexperienced in singing (we are
            not talking about those who did their part in the art of singing) play this example – he will see and hear wonders.
          </p>

            But this singing rule is not to be understood in a way, that one necessarily makes his craft and being out of it or indeed
            has to be a singer in order to play neatly. For there are many valiant people, who naturally do not have a voice for singing.
            It is not necessary, that everbody has to gloat about a good throat.
            It is given only to fewest; but not only every composer,
            but every thorough-bass player, infact every instrumentalist, has to know the art of singing, and if his throat is of no use,
            at least his singing thoughts have to give the fingers their order, otherwise all is wooden and dead. Already D. Lippius
            knew to say that: <hi rendition="#b">That an instrumentalist is the more perfect, the more he turns to the art of singing.</hi>.
